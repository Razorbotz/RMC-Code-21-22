# Welcome to the Razorbotz NASA Robotic Mining Competition Project!
This page intends to provide a starting point and overview of the project, as well as a roadmap for how to get involved with the project even if you aren't familiar with the code or technology stack. Please note that these links may not be up to date and any links should be followed at your own risk.  If you find any links that no longer work or changes that need to be made, please contact me at andrewburroughs17@gmail.com.

## Documentation
This project uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate documentation for the files automatically.  To learn more about the Doxygen formatting, please refer to the [Documenting the code](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) section of the Doxygen docs.  The documentation for this project can be found at the project website that is found [here](https://razorbotz.github.io/CPP/).

### Documentation Template
To standardize the documentation across multiple authors, the following documentation template will be used throughout the project.  To see an example of how files should be commented to generate the documentation correctly, see [Example.cpp](https://github.com/Razorbotz/ROS2/blob/master/docs/Example.cpp).
